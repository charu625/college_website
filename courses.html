            The Department of Mechanical Engineering is actively associated in grooming the engineering graduates in 
            Mechanical Engineering by nurturing them with inputs from various basic and specialized subjects involving
             production, industrial, thermal and design engineering. A wide selection of projects, seminars and training
             facilities besides technical visits to industrial enterprises generates enormous potential and confidence
         among the students enabling them to independently handle the life size problems in their engineering careers.
     The department is conducting a 4-year full time undergraduate course-B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering with an annual
      intake of 60. The programme has been specially tailored to meet the growing global requirements and focuses on upcoming 
      manufacturing systems with a rigorous emphasis on automation and quality control. Current subjects like Production
       Engineering/Operation Management, CAD/CAM, Ergonomics, Robotics, Mechatronics etc. are highlights of the curriculum,
        besides ongoing advancements and computational product design and development to accept the face global competition.

            Per capita Electrical Energy Consumption is an index of the standard of living of a country and its industrial and economic potential. Needless to say, that our country is very badly lagging behind in this area. The realization has now dawned that if India were to achieve a sustained annual economic growth of around 10%, it would have to improve its infrastructure including power generation by a factor of at least two. The government has all the intention of doing it and power generation is now under sharp focus. Simultaneously, the field of electronics is advancing in a big way and finds its application in almost every field, be it communications, power generation, automation, defense, consumer, electronics, automobile engineering, control engineering or aerospace applications.

            There is a huge deficit in the demand and supply of well-qualified Electrical 
            Engineers in the country. With this view the Electrical Department was started. 
            The department has following fully equipped laboratories of Electrical Engineering
            <br><br>
            Research and specialization can be carried out in any of the following fields:
            <br><br>
            1. Circuit Analysis<br>
            2. Electro-Magnetism<br>
            3. Solid-State Electronics<br>
            4. Electric Machines<br>
            5. Electric Power Systems<br>
            6. Digital Logic Circuits<br>
            7. Computer Systems<br>
            8. Communication Systems<br>
            9. Electro-Optics<br>

            To become an eminent destination of technical education and research in the field of
             Electrical Engineering and to impart knowledge based value added education for economic, scientific and sustainable
              development of the state as a whole and society in general.
